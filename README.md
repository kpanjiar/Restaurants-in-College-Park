# Restaurants-in-College-Park
A detailed analysis into the restaurants in College Park and a focus on their calories and health values.
2019 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that more than one-third (36.5%) of U.S. adults age 20 and older were obese. With ever-growing obesity in US, people are becoming more aware of obesity and the negative health effects associated with it. 
With such growing health issues, it becomes imperitive for us to analyze the restaurants we eat at and how healthy they are.
This project aims to look at 29 restaurants in College Park, MD. The database includes the restaurantâ€™s name, location, phone number, average cost, amenities and its reviews. However, most importantly, the database contains the cuisine and food items offered by the restaurants along with the associated calories with each food item. 
Finally, the project aims to understand the health, price and overall accessibility of these restaurants using visualizations.

To make the project the following steps were taken:
1. Created a ER schema for the database
2. Download data from internet
3. Create tables in MySQL and enter values into database.
4. Run analysis on the database using MySQL
5. Create data visualization supporting our analysis on Tableau.

The files contained are as follows:
1. Entity Relationship Diagram using Lucidchart
2. ER Schema, Relations, Functional Dependencies, 3NF schema and Business Rules associated in Word.
3. MySQL files containing DDL and DML files
4. Data Visualizations in a Tableau file.
